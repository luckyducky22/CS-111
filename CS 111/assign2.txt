Problem One Analysis and Test cases:
Question:Ask the user for a number of judges and each of their scores. Then find the average of the scores excluding the highest and lowest scores. 


Input # of judges, each of their scores		Expected Output						Output 
3, 5,6,3						5						5
-2					"you cannot have a negative number of judges. enter again"		"you cannot have a negative number of judges. enter again"
2.5					"That is not an integer. enter again"				"That is not an integer. enter again"
score of above 10 or less than 			"User entered bad input"					"User entered bad input"
error conditions: 
Number of judges input cannot be a negative or a double number or char or string or number of judges need to be more than 2 
output of error: "That is not an integer. enter again"

Problem Two Analysis and Test cases:
Question: Ask the user for a termintating value and a sequence of numbers until that value is reached. Then determine which two numbers are the smallest. 

Input terminating value, rest of sequence		Expected Output						Output 
4,1,2,3,4					"the smallest and second smallest numbers are 1 and 2"		"the smallest and second smallest numbers are 1 and 2"
-5,-2,3,2,-5				"the smallest and second smallest numbers are -5 and -2"		"the smallest and second smallest numbers are -5 and -2"

error conditions:
input cannot be a char or string
output of error: "That is no	 an integer. enter again"
