Problem 1: 
1. trace using selection sort
M U E J R Q X B
B  U E J R Q X M - 7 COMPARISONS
B E  U J R Q X M - 6 COMPARISONS
B E J  U R Q X M - 5 COMPARISONS
B E J M  R Q X U - 4 COMPARISONS
B E J M Q  R X U - 3 COMPARISONS
B E J M Q R  X U - 2 COMPARISON 
B E J M Q R U X - 1 comparison

2. trace using insertion sort 
[] [M U E J R Q X B]
[M] [U E J R Q X B] - 0 COMPARISONS
[M U] [E J R Q X B] - 1 COMPARISON
[E M U] [J R Q X B] - 2 COMPARISONS
[E J M U] [R Q X B] - 3 COMPARISONS
[E J M Q R U] [X B] - 3 COMPARISONS
[E J M Q R U X] [B] - 1 COMPARISONS
[B E J M Q R U X] [] - 7 COMPARISON





problem 2:



a)Determine if 2 arrays contain the same elements
1. for int 1 to end of loop
	if array1[x] == array2[x] 
		count =0;
	else count =1;
	if count ==0 then both arrays are same. else they are not the same
2. 	 i)The amount of memory in the arrays  (A)
	ii) the type of data in each array (whether they are strings,characters, or numbers). (C)
 This can be known before the code is executed.  
3. Each comparison of 2 elements is counted. 
4. A^2 
5. Best case: if each array is exactly identical in the elements and the spots that they are in.
   Worst case: if each array has different elements and not in the same spots as each other. 
6. O(n^2) 
----------------

b) Counting total number characters that have a duplicate within a string 
(i.e. "gigi the gato" would result in 7 (g x 3 + i x 2 + t x 2)

1.for 1 to last element in array
	if at x == another spot in array 
		count variable increases 
	print out letter and how much of that letter if its count is not equal to 0 or 1. 



2. the amount of memory in the string (A) 
3. Each comparison of 2 elements is counted
4. a^2
5. best case: if all letters are same 
   worst case: if all letters ae different with no repeats 
6. O(n^2) 

----------------

c) Finding an empty row in a 2-D array where empty is defined as an element with a 0 entry.
1. nested loop 
	if all of row is filled with zero, then count is equal to current row.



2. the number of elements in the array [a] 
3. compare each element to the number zero. each comparison of 2 elements is counted.
4. a^2
5. best case: if first row all columns are with zero.
   worst cas: if last row has all zeros or none of the rows are all zeros 
6. O(n^2)
