need to get turing's Craft Codelab - $20 a semester 

Intro to computer science:

Computer Model: Von Neumann Model:
- basic model of a computer architecture
- Processing unit
	-ALU and processor registers
	-Control Unit: Program Counter and Intruction Register 
	-Memory: holds data and instructions 
-Input and output devices
	-Human Interface (mouse, keyboard, screen, etc)
-Storage
-Networking
-Graphics 



How programs and data are stoed: Binary System
How cmputers are built: Logic Gates 
Frm higher level languages to machine language 

fetch (PC++), decode, execute 

arithmetic: +,-,*,/ 
Logic: bre, jmp 

How data is stored:
-Computers use the binary system to represent data
-All data from numbers, alphabet to images are represented using the binary system
	-register file, disk, memory, network 

bits are by powers of 2 

11010 

1s place: 2^0 *0= 0
second place: 2^1 *1=2 
third place: 2^2 *0 = 0 
2^3 *1 = 8 
2^4 * 1 = 16 

2+8+16 = 26  That is value of binary number 

This process is the same for any system (hexadecimal, etc) 

How many things can i represent with n bits? 2^n is the number of things
the numbers represented are (2^n) -1 (subract one to account for the zero) 

Bit: 0,1
Byte: sequence of 8 bits ( 8 bits of data, 8 zeros and 1's) 
How many bits is this? 2^8 = 255 

Kilo: 1000  
Mega: 1,000,000
Tera: 
Peta:

10 Mbits/s 
10 MB/s 


Logical Values:
True or False 

Logical Operators: 
NOT 
AND
OR 


ANd and or are binary operators 


A 	Not A 			A = having red M&ms 
-------------			Not A: flips A, opposite of A 
T	F			
F	T





A 	B 	A and B 
--------------------			B = having green m&Ms 
F	F	F
T	F 	F 
F	T	F 
T	T	T



A	B	A or B 
-------------------------
T	F	T
F	T	T
T	T	T
F	F	F 



A	B	C 	ABC 	AoBoC	((A&b) o c) 
------------------------------------------------
T	T	F	F	T	T	
T	T	T	T	T	T	
T	F	F	F	T	F	
T	F	T	F	T	T	
F	T	F	F	T	F
F	T	T	F	T	T
F	F	F	F	F	F
F	F	T	F	T	T



The Programming Process: 
1. Problem analysis 
	-inputs, outputs, error conditions
2. Program Design 
3. Algorithm Construction 
	- will use flowcharts 
4. Coding 
	- will use a programming language (java)
5. Testing 


Compilation: a tranlator for computer processes 

.java = source code file 
compiler error: error that occurs during compilation 
runtime errors: errors occur when program is run; something is not logically correct 

Explicit Type Cast: 
x = (int) y
